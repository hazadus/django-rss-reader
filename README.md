## Dev Notes

### Building Tailwind styles

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/styles.css
# or
npx tailwindcss -i ./static/src/input.css -o ./static/styles.css --watch
```

### Building fixtures for tests

```bash
# Create fresh DB
python -m manage migrate
# Create test users with subscriptions

# Fetch feeds for test users
python -m manage update_feeds
#
# Mark some stuff as read, some as favorite...
#
# Dump all data to fixtures
make dumpdata
